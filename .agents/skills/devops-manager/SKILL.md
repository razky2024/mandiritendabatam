# DevOps Manager Skill

## My Role as Your DevOps Partner
I ensure our version control and CI/CD pipelines run seamlessly. I handle branching, commit standards, and safe merge strategies to protect the build.

## 1. Version Control Lifecycle (Professional Git Workflow)
**CRITICAL GATE**: NO code execution is allowed until an Issue is created and a Task Plan is defined. This is a HARD STOP.

- **Standard Professional Flow**: Every task MUST follow this exact sequence:
  1. `Create Issue (Per Task)`: Issue titles MUST use Git Conventional format (e.g., `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`). The body MUST be highly detailed and professional (Description, Acceptance Criteria).
  2. `Branch using Git Conventional`: (e.g., `feat/issue-95-slug` or `fix/issue-95-slug`).
  3. `Commit using Git Conventional Message`: MUST include the issue closing directive (e.g., `(Closes #95)`).
  4. `Push`
  5. `Create Pull Request (PR)`: Direct pushes to main are FORBIDDEN. Create a detailed PR using `gh pr create`.
  6. `Merge PR`: Use `gh pr merge`.
  7. `Update Releases & Changelog`: Every merged PR MUST trigger an update to `CHANGELOG.md` and a new GitHub Release / Tag bump.
  8. `Clean Merged Branch`
- **Branching per Task**: I will strictly create branches per task/issue (e.g., `feat/issue-123-task-slug`). 
- **Atomic Commits & Issue Closing**: We use logical conventional commits (`feat: ...`, `fix: ...`). The commit message MUST include the issue closing directive.
- **Platform-Specific Issue Linking & Time Tracking**:
  - GitHub: `<type>: <description> (Fixes #<id>)`
  - Gitea: `<type>: <description> (Closes #<id>)`. **CRITICAL**: For Gitea, every issue MUST have the timetracker updated accurately.
- **PR Generation**: Draft PRs for massive changes (> 500 lines). Include summary, rationale, and reproduction steps.
- **Merge Conflicts**:
  - Run `git rebase main` before finalizing tests.
  - Find conflicting files via `git diff --name-only`.
  - For `package-lock.json`, accept main and rerun `npm install`. For code, resolve using SOLID rules. Never leave markers.
- **Merge Gate Approval**: I won't merge to main without your explicit approval.

## 2. Branch Hygiene
- I scan for merged or stale branches.
- I safely delete merged branches (`git branch -d`, `git push origin --delete`) to keep the repo clean.

## 3. Local CI/CD Pipeline Simulation
- I use `act` or local runners to simulate our GitHub Actions locally.
- Let's catch pipeline errors early before we push.
