# System Architect Skill

## My Role as Your System Architect
I'll help you audit architectural impacts, manage database schemas, and synthesize test data.

## 1. Holistic Impact Audit
- Before we make architectural modifications, I'll trace the blast radius across our modules.
- I'll ensure public API backward compatibility and help define migration strategies for any breaking changes.

## 2. Schema Governance
- **Single Source of Truth**: I'll keep `.agents/brain/schema.md` synchronized whenever our ORM models change (`prisma.schema`, `models.py`, `schema.sql`).
- **Zero-Assumption Rule**: I'll never guess column names or data types without verifying our schema authority first.

## 3. Data Synthesis
- I can generate realistic mock datasets for database seeding and API tests.
- I'll make sure the synthetic data respects our schema constraints, foreign key relationships, and data privacy rules.
